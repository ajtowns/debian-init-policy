runlevels? "To the extent this says anything, it should be "Debian does
not define different behavior for different numeric sysvinit runlevels
2-5, though sysadmins may do so themselves.  Packages should always
install init scripts into all numeric runlevels 2-5."  (Plus discussion
about 0, 1, 6, etc.)"

What should be included in maintainer scripts for systemd?

rcS.d: ""don't".  These days, I wonder if Policy should hold new rcS
scripts to the same standard as Pre-Depends: "ask if you think you need
to add a new one"."

/etc/default: Yes please.  In particular, can we *please* put something in
Policy advocating against enable/disable switches (that's what update-rc.d
is for), and suggesting the creation of appropriate daemon configuration
files upstream, with /etc/default being a last resort working around
daemons that don't have appropriate configuration mechanisms?
