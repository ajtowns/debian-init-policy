runlevels? "To the extent this says anything, it should be "Debian does
not define different behavior for different numeric sysvinit runlevels
2-5, though sysadmins may do so themselves.  Packages should always
install init scripts into all numeric runlevels 2-5."  (Plus discussion
about 0, 1, 6, etc.)"

What should be included in maintainer scripts for systemd?

rcS.d: ""don't".  These days, I wonder if Policy should hold new rcS
scripts to the same standard as Pre-Depends: "ask if you think you need
to add a new one"."
