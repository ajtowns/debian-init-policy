policy-rc.d: shouldn't it take effect during boot as well as package
installation? the only thing that seems to use it is invoke-rc.d though;
update-rc.d or init itself would have to pay attention for it to affect
boot time as well. (if it's just for package installs, seems kinda complicated)

invoke-rc.d, update-rc.d, policy-rc.d are all poorly named...

service, invoke-rc.d, update-rc.d should probably work with .socket etc files, so
that systemd doesn't need different scripts to do the same things

force-reload needs to be mapped to reload-or-restart for systemd doesn't it? it
currently checks for "CanReload" then restarts or reloads.

why do rc.d directories even still exist when you're running
systemd? answer: systemd-sysv-generator uses them. shouldn't it use
init.d directly instead, and allow services that shouldn't be enabled
by default to be masked in systemd's usual manner?

should service be in /sbin rather than /usr/sbin? (matching redhat)

shouldn't deb-systemd-{invoke,helper} be in /usr/sbin? (not possible)

"(Also, in the course of reading it to find that out, I just discovered
the crazy behavior of "service foo reload" under systemd; if systemctl
says a service doesn't support "reload", service will go call
"/etc/init.d/foo reload", which fortunately will just call systemctl
foo reload anyway.)"
